She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat.

Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife.

This poor creature was found half dead, mangled beyond belief because of poachers. Hope's story really brings to light the horrible and illegal trade of rhino poaching. I don't know if you know, but some people value rhino horns more than the beautiful creatures they come from. I don't believe the initial attack on Hope was responsible for her death, but it brought this beautiful creature into the spotlight, and I'm very glad for hearing of her story and saddened by her passing.	sadness	1	6	1	34	48000	6.5	5.5	1.5	6.5	5.0	4.428999999999999	3.429	3.857	4.857

When the 2nd amendment was written could they imagine the way guns could have progressed or how they are being used today?

I think the solution is to hold off with allowing much Muslim immigration until Muslims start polling better on ideas involving apostates, etc.  As evidenced by polls (even in European countries), the ideas Muslims accept put them at odds with basic educational values.  I think seeking a professional to talk and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing.  The right therapy can likely help certain people.
